Ah, I understand! When I wrap it in a "code block" (the gray box), some editors double the characters or formatting when you paste.

Here is the **normal text** version. You can copy everything from the title `# 🎧 MeetLens` down to the end.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎙️ Intelligent Transcription & Audio Sync

* **Word-Level Highlighting:** A custom sticky audio player that highlights text in real-time as the audio plays.
* **Optimized for Indian English:** High-accuracy STT engine tuned for real-world business accents and non-studio environments.

### 🧠 AI-Powered Insights

* **Five Lenses of Analysis:** Summary, Action Items, Key Decisions, Highlights, and Tone Analysis.
* **Speaker Mapping:** Automatically identifies different voices and allows users to rename them (e.g., "Speaker 1" → "Manager") for a personalized transcript.

### 🧪 One-Click Demo (Sample Audios)

* **Pre-loaded Samples:** Includes a dedicated row of sample recordings (Sales Calls, Project Meetings, Support Calls) hosted locally for instant testing.
* **Auto-Populate:** Clicking a sample bypasses manual file selection, instantly triggering the analysis flow—perfect for quick judge reviews.

## 💰 Business & Revenue Model

MeetLens adopts a **Utility-First** model to align costs with user value.

### Pay-As-You-Go Pricing

> **₹5 per minute of audio analyzed**

* **Why this works:** Meetings are irregular. Users avoid "Subscription Fatigue" and only pay for what they use.
* **Predictable Margin:** AI infrastructure costs scale directly with audio length, ensuring a sustainable business model.
* **No Hidden Fees:** A single flat rate includes transcription plus all AI-generated insights.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** SvelteKit (Svelte 5 architecture)
* **Backend:** Node.js
* **Deployment:** Railway
* **State Management:** Custom Svelte Stores for session persistence.
* **UI/UX:** Bootstrap 5 + Glass-morphic Custom CSS.
